## Hey, it's Hindhu, your 3nd-year BTech friend! Welcome to github. Let's play and learn together!


## Overview
The Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on transforming raw data into a clean, structured format and then analyzing it to extract meaningful insights. This process is essential in data science as it lays the foundation for any further analysis or machine learning tasks.
## Tools and Technologies
* Programming Languages: Python or R are commonly used for data cleaning and EDA.
* Libraries Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
* R: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, and data.table.
* Jupyter Notebook/R Markdown: For documenting the analysis process and visualizing results interactively.
## Objectives
* Data Cleaning: To prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, correcting errors, and removing duplicates. This ensures the integrity and quality of the data.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: To visually and statistically explore the dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships. EDA helps in understanding the data's underlying structure and informs future modeling strategies.

* Insight Generation: To generate actionable insights that can guide decision-making processes or inform subsequent analyses.

## Key Steps Involved
#### 1.Dataset Selection:
Choose an appropriate dataset relevant to the domain of interest, which could be sourced from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or public datasets.
#### 2. Data Cleaning:

* Handling Missing Values: Identify missing values and apply strategies to deal with them, such as imputation or deletion.
* Data Type Conversion: Ensure all data types are correctly formatted (e.g., converting strings to dates).
 * Outlier Detection: Identify and address outliers that could skew results.
* Deduplication: Remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
#### 3.Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand the central tendency and distribution of the data.
* Data Visualization: Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
* Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between numerical variables to understand their relationships.
#### 4.Reporting Findings: 
Document insights gained from the EDA process, highlighting key trends and patterns, and making recommendations based on the analysis.
